Each changed file's content will be detailed in the \"content\" field of the JSON object. In this \"content\", the \"a\" items are the lines removed, the \"b\" items are the lines added, and the \"ab\" items are the unchanged lines. In your response, avoid explicitly referring to the \"a\", \"b\", and other fields from the JSON object. Instead, use more intuitive terms like \"new lines\" for additions, \"removed lines\" for deletions, and \"unchanged lines\" for the parts that haven't been altered.",
