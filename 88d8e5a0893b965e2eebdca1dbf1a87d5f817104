      "message": "This is a valid question. The requirement here is to store data programmatically and reliably. The term \u0027cache\u0027 suggests a temporary storage to reduce redundant calls, and I had concerns about how the cleanup mechanisms would handle data, eg during updates to the plugin or Gerrit itself.",
